# Block Roller

Mobile game, that will make you throw your phone away from the window!

## What this game is about?

You are playing for a little blocky snake, rotating it by pressing on the left and right part of the screen (A or S buttons on Desktop version). You should reach a finish line on top without colliding with walls or platforms. There are now two fully finished seasons of the game, 32 levels each, and two more are coming soon.
